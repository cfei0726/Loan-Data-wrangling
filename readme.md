##by CHEN YI FEI


## Dataset

> This dataset is financial dataset and this is related to the loan, borrowers, lenders, 
> interest rates and stuffs like that. This data set contains 113,937 loans with 
> 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), 
> current loan status, borrower income, and many others. 
> I am using the data from the Posper to analyse it and trying to find the pattern in the data

## Summary of Findings

> Regareding the Lender Yield,I found the Lender Yield of defaulted group is on average higher than non-default group. 
> The same patter still holds if borrower with home property or across income group. 
> To summarize all observations, personal financial health such as income, employment 
> and asset are the main factors to dertermine lender yield. Besides, Lender Yield also 
> implies higher default risk as we obseve that the yield of default group is much higher than the other.
